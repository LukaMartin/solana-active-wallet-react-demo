# Solana Active Wallet React Demo

This project is a demo of the Solana Active Wallet React library. It allows you to connect to a Solana wallet utilising the @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui wallet modal.
Once connected, you will see the active wallet address and a button to disconnect. Test the hook by changing you active wallet inside either you Backpack or Phantom wallet extension.
